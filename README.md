🚗 Motor Insurance Claim Prediction & Risk AnalyticsDeveloped by Puttimej Praomsin Applied Mathematics Student | Aspiring Data Analyst 📌 Project ObjectiveThe goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the probability of "Car Insurance Claims" based on a dataset of 10,000 customers. By leveraging historical data, this tool assists insurance companies in Risk Management and Pricing Optimization by identifying high-risk policyholders before they file a claim.🛠 Tech Stack & ToolsProgramming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier) Optimization: RandomizedSearchCV for Hyperparameter TuningDatabase: SQL (MySQL) for data retrieval logic Visualization: Power BI Desktop 📊 Project Workflow1. Data Cleaning & PreprocessingHandling Missing Values: Applied Median Imputation to CREDIT_SCORE and ANNUAL_MILEAGE to maintain statistical consistency.Feature Encoding: * Ordinal Encoding: Applied to hierarchical data such as AGE, INCOME, and DRIVING_EXPERIENCE.Binary Mapping: Converted categorical variables like GENDER and VEHICLE_YEAR into numeric formats.Feature Scaling: Implemented StandardScaler for Logistic Regression to ensure the model converges efficiently and coefficients are comparable.2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Identified that the overall Claim Rate is 31.33%.Discovered that drivers aged 16-25 and those with <10 years of experience represent the highest risk segments.Observed a negative correlation between Credit Score and claim probability, validating the "Financial Responsibility" hypothesis in insurance underwriting.3. Machine Learning ModelingTwo models were evaluated to determine the best predictive performance:Logistic Regression: Built as a statistical baseline using the sigmoid function:$$P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n)}}$$Random Forest: Optimized via RandomizedSearchCV to handle potential non-linear relationships and prevent overfitting.🏆 Key Results & PerformanceModelAccuracyAUC-ROC ScoreLogistic Regression84%0.90Random Forest (Tuned)83%0.89Key Insight: Logistic Regression performed exceptionally well (AUC = 0.90), indicating a strong linear relationship between the chosen features and the claim outcome.📈 Power BI Dashboard FeaturesThe interactive dashboard is structured into three main views:Executive Summary: High-level KPIs including Total Policies, Claim Rate, and Revenue Risk.Risk Profile Analysis: Deep dive into demographics (Age, Income, Marriage status) vs. Claim Outcomes.ML Insights & Simulation: A "What-If" Parameter tool allowing users to simulate claim probabilities by adjusting inputs like Credit Score and Annual Mileage.📁 Repository Structure/data: Contains raw and cleaned datasets./notebooks: Jupyter Notebook detailing the End-to-End ML pipeline./dashboard: Power BI file (.pbix) and exported reports.README.md: Project documentation.📬 Contact InformationName: Puttimej Praomsin Education: B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang Email: Puttimej@gmail.com GitHub: github.com/puttibenz
